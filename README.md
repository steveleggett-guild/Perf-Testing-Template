### Notes about adding new tests:

Testing solution is written in page object pattern. When adding a new test, the following should be kept in mind:

**Object repository** is used to describe selectors and types.
**Page repository** is used to either set the state of the page or get a value to perform an assertion on it, that being said, having an assertion in test file spec.ts. is preferred approach unless it's a complex assertion.

Lib folder contains:
 - **Base test** is used to inject the page under the test in test file spec.ts. 
 - **Helpers** is used for global methods, such as fetching credentials. 
 - **WebActions** is used to abstract common interactions with a web ui, unless newly added method can be applied to any page repository, keep it at the level of the page repository under test.
